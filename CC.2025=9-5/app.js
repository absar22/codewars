// Given a string of arbitrary length with any ascii characters. Write a function to determine whether the string contains the whole word "English".

// The order of characters is important -- a string "abcEnglishdef" is correct but "abcnEglishsef" is not correct.

// Upper or lower case letter does not matter -- "eNglisH" is also correct.

// Return value as boolean values, true for the string to contains "English", false for it does not.

function spEng(sentence){
  return sentence.toLowerCase().includes("english");
}

// This function should return an object, but it's not doing what's intended. What's wrong?

  var results =
    {sanity: 'Hello'};

}

// Create a function that checks if a number n is divisible by two numbers x AND y. All inputs are positive, non-zero numbers.

// Examples:
// 1) n =   3, x = 1, y = 3 =>  true because   3 is divisible by 1 and 3
// 2) n =  12, x = 2, y = 6 =>  true because  12 is divisible by 2 and 6
// 3) n = 100, x = 5, y = 3 => false because 100 is not divisible by 3
// 4) n =  12, x = 7, y = 5 => false because  12 is neither divisible by 7 nor 5

const isDivisible = (n, x, y) => n % x === 0 && n % y === 0

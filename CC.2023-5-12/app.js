// Check your arrows
// You have a quiver of arrows, but some have been damaged. The quiver contains arrows with an optional range information (different types of targets are positioned at different ranges), so each item is an arrow.
// You need to verify that you have some good ones left, in order to prepare for battle:

// anyArrows([{range: 5}, {range: 10, damaged: true}, {damaged: true}])
// If an arrow in the quiver does not have a damaged status, it means it's new.

// The expected result is a boolean, indicating whether you have any good arrows left.

function anyArrows(arrows){
  // arrow it
  return arrows.some(arrow => !arrow.damaged );

// According to the creation myths of the Abrahamic religions, Adam and Eve were the first Humans to wander the Earth.

// You have to do God's job. The creation method must return an array of length 2 containing objects (representing Adam and Eve). The first object in the array should be an instance of the class Man. The second should be an instance of the class Woman. Both objects have to be subclasses of Human. Your job is to implement the Human, Man and Woman classes.

class Human {
  constructor() {}
}

class Man extends Human {
  constructor() {
    super();
  }
}

class Woman extends Human {
  constructor() {
    super();
  }
}

class God {
  static create() {
    const adam = new Man();
    const eve = new Woman();
    return [adam, eve];
  }
}

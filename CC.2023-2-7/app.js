// You have an award-winning garden and every day the plants need exactly 40mm of water. You created a great piece of JavaScript to calculate the amount of water your plants will need when you have taken into consideration the amount of rain water that is forecast for the day. Your jealous neighbour hacked your computer and filled your code with bugs.

// Your task is to debug the code before your plants die!


function rainAmount(mm){
  if (mm < 40) {
       return `You need to give your plant ${40 - mm}mm of water`
  }
  else {
       return "Your plant has had more than enough water for today!"
  }
}


// Grasshopper Order of Operations
// You are running the calculation 2 + 2 * 2 + 2 * 2 and expect to get the answer 32 but instead the function keeps returning 10. Fix the function to make it return 32 without changing the number or the operators.

function orderOperations () {
  return (2 + 2) * (2 + 2) * 2
}


// Terminal Game - Create Hero Prototype
// In this first kata in the series, you need to define a Hero prototype to be used in a terminal game. The hero should have the following attributes:

// attribute	value
// name	user argument or 'Hero'
// position	'00'
// health	100
// damage	5
// experience	0

function Hero (name) {
  // add default values here
  this.name = name || 'Hero';
  this.position = '00';
  this.health = 100;
  this.damage = 5;
  this.experience = 0;
}

// Task
// Given a length, an offset, and a list, slide a window of that length, moving by that offset every step, over the list, returning a list of lists.

// The windows may overlap each other, or skip certain elements. All windows should be of the given length; if insufficient elements remain after a certain offset, end the list of lists. It is possible to take 0 elements from an empty list, so take care to handle window(0,offset,list) correctly.

// The length will always be non-negative; the offset will always be strictly positive.

// Examples
// for 2, 1, [0,1,2,3,4] return [ [0,1], [1,2], [2,3], [3,4] ]
// for 2, 2, [0,1,2,3,4] return [ [0,1], [2,3] ]
// for 2, 3, [0,1,2,3,4] return [ [0,1], [3,4] ]

// The purpose of this kata is to work out just how many bottles of duty free whiskey you would have to buy such that the savings over the normal high street price would effectively cover the cost of your holiday.

// You will be given the high street price (normPrice, in £ (Pounds)), the duty free discount (discount, in percent) and the cost of the holiday (in £).

// For example, if a bottle costs £10 normally and the duty free discount is 10%, you would save £1 per bottle. If your holiday will cost £500, you would have to purchase 500 bottles to save £500, so the answer you return should be 500.

// Another example: if a bottle costs £12 normally and the duty free discount is 50%, you would save £6 per bottle. If your holiday will cost £1000, you would have to purchase 166.66 bottles to save £1000, so your answer should be 166 bottles.

// All inputs will be integers. Please return an integer. Round down.

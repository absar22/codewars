// You're at the zoo... all the meerkats look weird. Something has gone terribly wrong - someone has gone and switched their heads and tails around!

// Save the animals by switching them back. You will be given an array which will have three values (tail, body, head). It is your job to re-arrange the array so that the animal is the right way round (head, body, tail).

// Same goes for all the other arrays/lists that you will get in the tests: you have to change the element positions with the same exact logics

function fixTheMeerkat(arr) {
  //your code here 
    return  arr.reverse()
 }


//  This kata is from check py.checkio.org

// You are given an array with positive numbers and a non-negative number N. You should find the N-th power of the element in the array with the index N. If N is outside of the array, then return -1. Don't forget that the first element has the index 0.

// Let's look at a few examples:

// array = [1, 2, 3, 4] and N = 2, then the result is 3^2 == 9;
// array = [1, 2, 3] and N = 3, but N is outside of the array, so the result is -1.


function index(array, n){
  //your code here
if(n >= array.length){
  return -1
}
  return Math.pow(array[n], n)
}

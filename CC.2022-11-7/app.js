// Fix the function
// I created this function to add five to any number that was passed in to it and return the new value. It doesn't throw any errors but it returns the wrong number.

// Can you help me fix the function?

function addFive(num) {
  var total = num + 5
  return total
}

// Create a combat function that takes the player's current health and the amount of damage recieved, and returns the player's new health. Health can't be less than 0.

    return 0
  }else {
    return currentHealth
  }
    
  }
  console.log(combat(100,30))

//   The cockroach is one of the fastest insects. Write a function which takes its speed in km per hour and returns it in cm per second, rounded down to the integer (= floored).

// For example:

// 1.08 --> 30
// Note! The input is a Real number (actual type is language dependent) and is >= 0. The result should be an Integer.

function cockroachSpeed(s) {
  //Good Luck!
  let cm = Math.floor(s / 0.036)
  return cm

// Given two integers a and b, which can be positive or negative, find the sum of all the integers between and including them and return it. If the two numbers are equal return a or b.

// Note: a and b are not ordered!

// Examples (a, b) --> output (explanation)
// (1, 0) --> 1 (1 + 0 = 1)
// (1, 2) --> 3 (1 + 2 = 3)
// (0, 1) --> 1 (0 + 1 = 1)
// (1, 1) --> 1 (1 since both are same)
// (-1, 0) --> -1 (-1 + 0 = -1)
// (-1, 2) --> 2 (-1 + 0 + 1 + 2 = 2)
// Your function should only return a number, not the explanation about how you get that number.

// Make a program that filters a list of strings and returns a list with only your friends name in it.

// If a name has exactly 4 letters in it, you can be sure that it has to be a friend of yours! Otherwise, you can be sure he's not...

// Input = ["Ryan", "Kieran", "Jason", "Yous"]
// Output = ["Ryan", "Yous"]

// Input = ["Peter", "Stephen", "Joe"]
// Output = []
// Input strings will only contain letters.
// Note: keep the original order of the names in the output.

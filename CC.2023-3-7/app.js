// Write a function that takes an array of strings as an argument and returns a sorted array containing the same strings, ordered from shortest to longest.

// For example, if this array were passed as an argument:

// ["Telescopes", "Glasses", "Eyes", "Monocles"]

// Your function would return the following array:

// ["Eyes", "Glasses", "Monocles", "Telescopes"]

// All of the strings in the array passed to your function will be different lengths, so you will not have to decide how to order multiple strings of the same length.


function sortByLength (array) {
  // Return an array containing the same strings, ordered from shortest to longest
  return array.sort((a,b) => a.length - b.length)
};

// The two oldest ages function/method needs to be completed. It should take an array of numbers as its argument and return the two highest numbers within the array. The returned value should be an array in the format [second oldest age,  oldest age].

// The order of the numbers passed in could be any order. The array will always include at least 2 items. If there are two or more oldest age, then return both of them in array format.

// For example (Input --> Output):

// [1, 2, 10, 8] --> [8, 10]
// [1, 5, 87, 45, 8, 8] --> [45, 87]
// [1, 3, 10, 0]) --> [3, 10]

function twoOldestAges(ages){
  let sorted = ages.sort((a,b) => a - b)
    return  [sorted[sorted.length -2] , sorted[sorted.length -1]]
  }

// You are given a method called main, make it print the line Hello World!, (yes, that includes a new line character at the end) and don't return anything

// Note that for some languages, the function main is the entry point of the program.

// Here's how it will be tested:

//     Solution.main("parameter1","parameter2");

class Solution{
  static main() {
     console.log('Hello World!')
   }
 }
 

//  Task
// misson 1: I've create three function, and defined some global variables, please select some variables that can make up the name of the function, and return them(Please note the uppercase and lowercase letters are different).

// When you have finished the work, click "Run Tests" to see if your code is working properly.

// misson 2: After misson 1 finished. you should click "Attempt" to see my three questions, and write the answer in function answer1, answer2,answer3

// If everything is right, click "Submit" again to submit your code pass this kata.

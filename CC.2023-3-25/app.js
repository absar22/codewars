// Debug celsius converter
// Your friend is traveling abroad to the United States so he wrote a program to convert fahrenheit to celsius. Unfortunately his code has some bugs.

// Find the errors in the code to get the celsius converter working properly.

// To convert fahrenheit to celsius:

// celsius = (fahrenheit - 32) * (5/9)
// Remember that typically temperatures in the current weather conditions are given in whole numbers. It is possible for temperature sensors to report temperatures with a higher accuracy such as to the nearest tenth. Instrument error though makes this sort of accuracy unreliable for many types of temperature measuring sensors.

function weatherInfo (temp) {
  let c =  (temp - 32) * (5/9)
  if (c <= 0)
    return (c + " is freezing temperature")
  else
    return (c + " is above freezing temperature")
}

// You have to write a function that accepts three parameters:

// cap is the amount of people the bus can hold excluding the driver.
// on is the number of people on the bus excluding the driver.
// wait is the number of people waiting to get on to the bus excluding the driver.
// If there is enough space, return 0, and if there isn't, return the number of passengers he can't take.

// Usage Examples:
// cap = 10, on = 5, wait = 5 --> 0 # He can fit all 5 passengers
// cap = 100, on = 60, wait = 50 --> 10 # He can't fit 10 of the 50 waiting

function enough(cap, on, wait) {
  // your code here
  let availabeSeat = cap - on
  if( availabeSeat >= wait) return 0
  else {
   return  wait - availabeSeat
  }
}

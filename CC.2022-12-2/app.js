// Inspired by the development team at Vooza, write the function that

// accepts the name of a programmer, and
// returns the number of lightsabers owned by that person.
// The only person who owns lightsabers is Zach, by the way. He owns 18, which is an awesome number of lightsabers. Anyone else owns 0.

// Note: your function should have a default parameter.

// For example(Input --> Output):

// "anyone else" --> 0
// "Zach" --> 18

function howManyLightsabersDoYouOwn(name) {
  if(name === 'Zach')  return 18
  else return 0
}

// Task
// Please refer to two example above and write your first JS function.

// mission 1:

// use keyword function to define your function, function name should be helloWorld(don't forget the () and {})

// mission 2:

// use keyword var (or let or const) to define a variable str, value of str should be a string: "Hello World!"(don't forget the =).

// mission 3:

// type the console.log() in the next line (don't forget to put the str in the parentheses).

// When you have finished the work, click "Run Tests" to see if your code is working properly.

// In the end, click "Submit" to submit your code pass this kata.


function helloWorld(){
  let str = 'Hello World!'
  console.log(str)
}

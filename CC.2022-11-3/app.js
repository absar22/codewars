// Alex just got a new hula hoop, he loves it but feels discouraged because his little brother is better than him

// Write a program where Alex can input (n) how many times the hoop goes round and it will return him an encouraging message :)

// If Alex gets 10 or more hoops, return the string "Great, now move on to tricks".
// If he doesn't get 10 hoops, return the string "Keep at it until you get it".

function hoopCount (n) {
  //your code goes here
if(n < 10){
  return 'Keep at it until you get it'
}else {
  return 'Great, now move on to tricks'
}
}

// Create a function finalGrade, which calculates the final grade of a student depending on two parameters: a grade for the exam and a number of completed projects.

// This function should take two arguments: exam - grade for exam (from 0 to 100); projects - number of completed projects (from 0 and above);

// This function should return a number (final grade). There are four types of final grades:

// 100, if a grade for the exam is more than 90 or if a number of completed projects more than 10.
// 90, if a grade for the exam is more than 75 and if a number of completed projects is minimum 5.
// 75, if a grade for the exam is more than 50 and if a number of completed projects is minimum 2.
// 0, in other cases
// Examples(Inputs-->Output):

// 100, 12 --> 100
// 99, 0 --> 100
// 10, 15 --> 100

// 85, 5 --> 90

// 55, 3 --> 75

// 55, 0 --> 0
// 20, 2 --> 0

// The Western Suburbs Croquet Club has two categories of membership, Senior and Open. They would like your help with an application form that will tell prospective members which category they will be placed.

// To be a senior, a member must be at least 55 years old and have a handicap greater than 7. In this croquet club, handicaps range from -2 to +26; the better the player the lower the handicap.

// Input
// Input will consist of a list of pairs. Each pair contains information for a single potential member. Information consists of an integer for the person's age and an integer for the person's handicap.

// Output
// Output will consist of a list of string values (in Haskell and C: Open or Senior) stating whether the respective member is to be placed in the senior or open category.

// Example
// input =  [[18, 20], [45, 2], [61, 12], [37, 6], [21, 21], [78, 9]]
// output = ["Open", "Open", "Senior", "Open", "Open", "Senior"]

// Take 2 strings s1 and s2 including only letters from a to z. Return a new sorted string (alphabetical ascending), the longest possible, containing distinct letters - each taken only once - coming from s1 or s2.

// Examples:
// a = "xyaabbbccccdefww"
// b = "xxxxyyyyabklmopq"
// longest(a, b) -> "abcdefklmopqwxy"

// a = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
// longest(a, a) -> "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"

// There is a bus moving in the city which takes and drops some people at each bus stop.

// You are provided with a list (or array) of integer pairs. Elements of each pair represent the number of people that get on the bus (the first item) and the number of people that get off the bus (the second item) at a bus stop.

// Your task is to return the number of people who are still on the bus after the last bus stop (after the last array). Even though it is the last bus stop, the bus might not be empty and some people might still be inside the bus, they are probably sleeping there :D

// Take a look on the test cases.

// Please keep in mind that the test cases ensure that the number of people in the bus is always >= 0. So the returned integer can't be negative.

// The second value in the first pair in the array is 0, since the bus is empty in the first bus stop.


var number = function(busStops){
  let people = 0
  for(let i = 0; i < busStops.length;i++){
    let [on,off] = busStops[i]

  }

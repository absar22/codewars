// Clock shows h hours, m minutes and s seconds after midnight.

// Your task is to write a function which returns the time since midnight in milliseconds.

// Example:
// h = 0
// m = 1
// s = 1

// result = 61000
// Input constraints:

// 0 <= h <= 23
// 0 <= m <= 59
// 0 <= s <= 59

function past(h, m, s){
  //#Happy Coding! ^_^
  
  let hour = h  * 3600000
  let minute  = m * 60000
  let second = s * 1000
  let sum = hour + minute + second
  return sum
  
  
}
console.log(past(0,1,1))


// There was a test in your class and you passed it. Congratulations!
// But you're an ambitious person. You want to know if you're better than the average student in your class.

// You receive an array with your peers' test scores. Now calculate the average and compare your score!

// Return True if you're better, else False!

// Note:
// Your points are not included in the array of your class's points. For calculating the average point you may add your point to the given array!

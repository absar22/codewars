// *** No Loops Allowed ***

// You will be given an array a and a value x. All you need to do is check whether the provided array contains the value, without using a loop.

// Array can contain numbers or strings. x can be either. Return true if the array contains the value, false if not. With strings you will need to account for case.

// Looking for more, loop-restrained fun? Check out the other kata in the series:

function check(a,x){
  return a.includes(x)
};

// I've hit a few bugs in my Java/Type/Coffee-script code recently, and I've traced the problem back to the global isNaN function I was using. I had expected it to be more discerning, but it's returning true for undefined right now.

// Write a function isReallyNaN that returns true only if passed in an argument that evalutes to NaN, and returns false otherwise.

// Any solution is acceptable!
